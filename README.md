# MusiMatch
connecting between talented people.

Our project is actually a kind of social platform designed to create "matching" between creators in the world of music.
The application is intended for poets/composers who want to share their works and receive relevant criticism from other people online.
Each registered user will have the option to upload a new piece, of two possible types - text or melody.
Since there are thousands of genres in the world of music, and in order to create efficiency for users searching for certain topics and genres,
the user will be able to brand his creation by choosing from a variety of possible tags.
The other users will be able to watch/listen to the various works, depending on their level and give relevant comments,
and if they like it, of course, a "match" can be created and that user can fill in the gaps (text/melody) to create the complete song.
Our goal is also to integrate singers who will be able to collect the following successful hits from the platform. In order to control all the data,
in addition to the application, we also created a Web application that will be used as a management interface,
where we can monitor the user data and even create various statistics that can be used by us in the future for optimization.
